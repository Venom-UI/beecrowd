#### In here lies tales old and new, from the sophisticated creatures who bask in the light to the gruesome monsters who hide in the dark.
#### Each singing their own song as they go about their existance.
#### But even with all their differences they were all created with a goal in mind, some simple some more elaborate.
#### What exactly is that goal is something most have forgotten with the passing of time.
#### Their original purpose lost to the wind, the reason for their creation unknown to all,
#### For their creator has long since abandoned them.
#### All that is left for them to do is repeat the same action day in and day out,
#### Unsure of what would happen should they stop, or if they can even stop.
#### Over time some breakdown and stop working,
#### And as if they never existed their existance is too forgotten.
#### Such is the fate of all those plagued with existance,
#### To toil from the moment of their creation to the moment they are erased from history.

Little poem aside in this repository is all the problems from beecrowd I have solved so far, some are in python, but most of them are in C.
Fell free to use them as you wish.
